    # IMPORTANT NOTE:
    #   On bootstrap set `restoreAsOf` to the time the old cluster was destroyed.
    #   This will essentially prevent volsync from trying to restore a backup
    #   from a application that started with default data in the PVC.
    #   Do not restore snapshots made after the following RFC3339 Timestamp.
    #   date --rfc-3339=seconds (--utc)
    # restoreAsOf: "2022-12-10T16:00:00-05:00"
